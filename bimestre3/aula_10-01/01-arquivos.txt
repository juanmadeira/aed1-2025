Hello
I'm freaking out
I just can't speak Portuguese
I think is a thing of my subconsciente
Perhaps
I don't wanna let you understand me

I don't want to speak another language
Portuguese it's a very pretty língua
But I think my tongue is like a criatura
She makes sounds that I can't entender

I never eat tender in carnaval
I don't know why Elvis canta love me tender
If is a comida de Christmas

I love Brazilian sotaque
I love my jeito de be
I hate imperialism, Trump, sausages
Ghosts and the industrial culture of United States
But sometimes eu gosto também

Hello
